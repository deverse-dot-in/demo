# Issue: Input Field Value Resetting on Reload

## Description:

In the form, when using the `useFormWithStorage` hook to persist form data across sessions using `sessionStorage`, the input is experiencing an unexpected behavior. Upon page reload, the content entered into the input is lost, and the fields revert to their default empty state.

The intended functionality is that the `useFormWithStorage` hook should automatically save the form data to `sessionStorage` as the user interacts with the form. Upon page reload, the hook should retrieve this saved data from `sessionStorage` and repopulate all form fields, including inputs, with the previously entered values. This ensures a seamless user experience by preserving form state across page reloads or browser sessions.
